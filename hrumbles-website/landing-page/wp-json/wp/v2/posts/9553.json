It\u2019s not just about telling them how they did, but also giving them some pointers to get better and sharpen their skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, this feedback is a big deal for employers too. It helps you make smarter choices when you\u2019re deciding who to hire. Plus, it makes the whole interview process feel better for the candidates, which makes your company look good.

It\u2019s not just a simple \u201cyou\u2019re in\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re out.\u201d It\u2019s more about giving candidates a heads-up on what rocked and what maybe didn\u2019t.

Are they the kind of person who\u2019ll vibe with your team?&nbsp;Second, assess their skills and know-how. It\u2019s about striking a balance in your feedback \u2013 acknowledging their strengths and also seeing if they\u2019d really click with the way your company rolls.

It\u2019s an opportunity to guide and inspire candidates, shaping their future endeavors and reflecting your company\u2019s ethos. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the dos and don\u2019ts to make your feedback as effective as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Dos of Giving Job Interview Feedback<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be Genuine and Practical<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When giving feedback, be honest but empathetic. Offer practical, achievable advice that the candidate can use to improve. This approach ensures the feedback is both helpful and respectful. Focus on strengths and areas for development, providing guidance that is realistic and tailored to the candidate\u2019s performance. This helps them understand their potential and areas of growth, making the feedback a valuable tool for their professional advancement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus on Behavior and Skills<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Center your feedback on specific behaviors and skills observed during the interview. This objective approach ensures feedback is relevant and focused. Discuss key instances that highlight their abilities and areas where improvement is needed. By concentrating on observable actions and skills, your feedback becomes a constructive tool, providing clear insights into their performance and offering a solid foundation for future growth and refinement in their career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Offer Actionable Suggestions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Always include practical suggestions in your feedback. This helps candidates understand their areas for improvement and provides them with clear steps for progress. Tailor these suggestions to their specific challenges and strengths, encouraging continued development and learning. This approach not only clarifies their weaknesses but also empowers them with strategies to enhance their skills, making the feedback a roadmap for improvement in future professional endeavors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Express Appreciation for Their Effort<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognize the candidate\u2019s effort and dedication in preparing for and attending the interview. This acknowledgment boosts their morale and shows your company values their time and effort, regardless of the outcome. Appreciating their commitment reinforces a positive relationship, potentially encouraging future interactions. It demonstrates your company\u2019s respect and gratitude, contributing to a positive image and encouraging a culture of mutual respect and recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maintain a Positive and Professional Tone&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure your feedback is delivered in a positive and professional manner. This tone helps the candidate receive the feedback constructively, fostering a respectful and supportive dialogue. A positive approach encourages candidates to view the feedback as a growth opportunity rather than criticism. Maintaining professionalism reinforces your company\u2019s standards and values, ensuring the feedback process reflects the company\u2019s commitment to constructive\u00a0communication\u00a0and employee development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"394\" src=\"https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-658-1024x394.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9555\" style=\"border-radius:20px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-658-1024x394.png 1024w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-658-300x115.png 300w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-658-768x295.png 768w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-658-1536x590.png 1536w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-658.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Don\u2019ts of Giving Job Interview Feedback<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Provide Vague or General Feedback<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid giving feedback that is vague or overly general. Candidates benefit more from specific, concrete feedback that clearly identifies areas of strength and improvement. General comments can be confusing and unhelpful, lacking the detail necessary for candidates to understand their performance. Detailed feedback demonstrates that the interview process is thorough and thoughtful, ensuring candidates feel valued and respected, and providing them with clear direction for future growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Focus Solely on Negatives<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While addressing areas of improvement is important, it\u2019s crucial to balance this with positive observations. Highlighting strengths alongside weaknesses provides a more complete picture of the candidate\u2019s performance. This balanced approach encourages candidates by acknowledging their capabilities, while also guiding them on how to enhance their skills. Constructive feedback that includes positive elements fosters a more receptive and motivated attitude in candidates, aiding their professional development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Make Personal Comments<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your feedback strictly professional and job-related. Personal comments are inappropriate and detract from the objective nature of the feedback. Focusing on job-related skills and behaviors ensures the feedback is relevant and useful for the candidate\u2019s professional growth. This approach maintains a respectful and professional atmosphere, avoiding any discomfort or misunderstanding, and ensuring the feedback process upholds the highest standards of professionalism and respect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Delay Giving Feedback<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing timely feedback is essential. Delaying feedback can diminish its effectiveness and create unnecessary stress for the candidate. Prompt feedback demonstrates efficiency and respect for the candidate\u2019s time and effort. It ensures the candidate can quickly reflect on and learn from the experience, applying the insights to future opportunities. Timely feedback contributes to a positive candidate experience, reflecting well on your company\u2019s recruitment practices and commitment to respectful\u00a0communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Compare&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid making comparisons between candidates. Focus solely on the individual candidate\u2019s performance and potential. This ensures feedback is personalized and relevant, offering specific insights into their unique strengths and areas for improvement. Comparisons can be unfair and unproductive, detracting from the individual\u2019s achievements and learning opportunities. Personalized feedback respects the candidate\u2019s individual journey and contributions, fostering a more accurate and constructive assessment of their suitability for the role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"394\" src=\"https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-665-1024x394.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9556\" style=\"border-radius:20px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-665-1024x394.png 1024w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-665-300x115.png 300w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-665-768x295.png 768w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-665-1536x590.png 1536w, https:\/\/oorwin.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Frame-665.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5 Effective Interview Feedback Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example #1: Constructive Feedback&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYour technical skills are quite impressive.
